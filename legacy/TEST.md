## Morning Light

The dawn breaks soft through curtained glass,
A gentle hush on dewy grass,
The world awakens, breath by breath,
As night surrenders, fades to rest.

## The Coder's Lament

Between the brackets, truth resides,
In loops and functions, logic hides,
A semicolon missed at night
Can turn a dream into a fight.

## Ephemeral

We are but whispers in the wind,
Brief candles lit, then darkness pinned,
Yet in our fleeting, burning bright,
We leave behind a trail of light.

## Simple Things

A cup of tea on rainy days,
The sun that cuts through autumn haze,
A dog that greets you at the door—
What else could anyone ask for?
