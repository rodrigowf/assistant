Right now, your orchestrator agent lives in the backend, managing different conversations and tools. The challenge is that the voice API’s WebRTC connection goes straight from the frontend to the model, bypassing your backend orchestrator.\n\nWhat you’re proposing is to replace the current text-based model in the orchestrator with this real-time voice model, and stream all conversation data—voice, actions, everything—through a wrapper on the backend. That way, your orchestrator stays in control and processes the full multimodal conversation flow.\n\nI’m familiar with these concepts, and it’s a smart approach. Now we can dig into the research to confirm the exact requirements and outline how to implement this transition smoothly. Sound good?",

From what you've described, we need to maintain the full history—transcriptions, tool calls, everything—and allow switching between voice and text modes at any point. That means session management should be seamless, and the JSONL logs should capture the entire flow—whether it’s a voice interaction or a text one. \n\nSo, your preference is that typing should not be allowed simultaneously with voice in the initial version, and we keep the text mode as a separate flow.
