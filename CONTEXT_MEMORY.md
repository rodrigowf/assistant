## Project Overview
- The project is a personal AI assistant built on the Claude Agent SDK.
- It is transparent, self-improving, and runs entirely locally.
- The assistant can create new skills, modify existing ones, and edit its own wrapper code.
- The project includes a FastAPI backend, a Claude SDK wrapper, a React frontend, and custom slash commands.
- It is developer-native and designed as a dev environment rather than a chatbot UI.
- The stack includes Python 3.12+, Node.js 20+, FastAPI, React, and Claude Code CLI.

## Key Feature
- There is a specific skill that can spin up a test environment for the frontend, which acts as a wrapper for the customized Claude agent.
- The assistant’s wrapper code is open and can be used for debugging through the existing skills.
